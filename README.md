Welcome to my research website. I am a community ecologist studying the causes and consequences of forest biodiversity. I am also interested in how we can apply the knowledge gained in community ecology to forestry. I am currently studying the ways in which plant and fungal communities assemble and affect biogeochemical cycles in managed forests.
